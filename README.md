# Shark-Bot
This is a discord bot that was created for a streamer's, sharkocalypse, discord server.

# Features:
## 1. Welcome and Goodbye:
The bot can welcome people to the server and announce their departure from the server.

## 2. React Roles:
The bot has the capability to do react roles with an unlimited number of react role messages.

## 3. Shark catch game:
The bot has a built in game loop where every 30 minutes a random shark is found with a random rarity where users can come and attempt to catch it. Their success is dictated by the net they have, the better the net the higher the chances!

## 4. Fishing:
The bot has a built in fishing feature now where you can use a command like `?fish` and it would tell you how to move from there.

## 5. Birthday Loop
The bot has the capability of sending a happy birthday message to a role on the first of each month (for example, it would @janurary babies on the first of janurary).

## 6. Leveling system (under construction):
This feature is still in the works, but it's a levelling system just like Mee6 where it takes the messages people send and add it to their XP and level up whenever necessary.

## 7. Ticketing system:
This feature is still being worked on, but it is a ticketting system that would work like mod mail as a simple example
